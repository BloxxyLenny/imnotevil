A project I've made for a school project which I wanted to shere here.
It's all just a page that allows You to search the internet using duckduck.go, with the link not being generated using a user token, which in theory gets rid of issue
where Your search history gets registered. Is it working really? I'm not sure, though at the end of the day I did in fact got an A- with that.
